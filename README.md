what i did in this project

i used 2 states in react, a number string, a total
these are states because it would be ideal if it updated everytime this value updates since in calculators all u see is the numbers ur typing and a string,

when user types in a number it is generating a string, then when u choose a exponent that string gets parsed into a number and the math is done using javascript.

after math is done it gets converted back into a string and stored in the state.

DESIGN.
this design was heavily inspired by Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering, i tried to make making a calculator as cool as possible and im proud of how the design came out,

The screen was made by putting a screen texture over a div, and the underlying 8's like a classic calculator has is made by a lowered opactiy layer under the main Number String

Added a calculator in the top right with *insert library name*, i chose this library because of the ease of use and how well it can handle what i needed.

Since i was going for a Pokcet Operator look i learned how to remake it
the stripes under the buttons where made using a repeating gradient in css with a width of 1px creating that look, creating sections in the buttons for numbers and operations.

the dial buttons are purely asthetic but they do have a randomly set rotation so they arent the same everytime, when sliders are clicked they rotate more, just like a pocket operator.
